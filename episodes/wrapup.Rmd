## The goal

## Self-assessment template

During this process, we can self-assess our progress in these [good practices in scientific computing]([Wilson et al. 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)) using a __review checklists__ like the one used by [JOSS, the Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_checklist.html).

We related these two references in one [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dsGg9RoD3yCEfgHAr0ARQ-nJ1RWSeCEXcycGk7dFRKs/edit?usp=sharing). Take a look!

## Write an individual learning reflection

Before we wrap up, please take 5 minutes to think over everything we have covered so far. 

- On a piece of paper, write down something that captures what you want to remember about the day. 
- The Instructor will not look at this - it is just for you.
 
If you do not know where to start, consider the following list for a starting point:

- Draw a concept map, connecting the material
- Draw pictures or a comic depicting one of the day's concepts
- Write an outline of the topics we covered
- Write a paragraph or "journal" entry about your experience of the workshop today
- Write down one thing that struck you the most

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
